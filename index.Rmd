## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to...
Census data in Texas and how many people are undercounted (especially racial minorities and low income citizens), and how that affects state/county funding and resources in these areas. If possible, I would like to see how this is related to voting accessibility and how the new restrictive photo ID voting laws are also affecting these populations.
